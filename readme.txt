== Notes ==
* Requires WordPress 3.6 or higher and WordPress 4.9 or lower!

* All navigation to main top menu is parent recursive. If you have a menu with sub pages then the top link will not be clickable unless you turn off the option to use mobile nav in the Customizer. 

* To set up social media links in the page footer: Appearance > Menus - then <Custom Links> to the left. Footer does not support depths of the child links below it. (No drop downs)
